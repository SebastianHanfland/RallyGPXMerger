## Version 2
It would be good to have a smoother way to a planning. Also fixing some smaller technical problems would be nice

### Tidying up
* [ ] Multiple jsons work fine in display mode
* [ ] Getting rid of previous zips and gpx
* [ ] Integrating some of Leo's feedback
* [ ] Having impressum etc if needed
* [ ] Finishing some features that where only added in haste 
* [ ] 


### New ideas
* [ ] Good start page
* [ ] Better general application design
* [ ] No need for manually fetching the data at least for the streets
  * [ ] Upload a Gpx leads to resolving it
  * [ ] Where do the user comply with the data using thing
  * [ ] On the fly calculation of the merged tracks
  * [ ] Having postcode fetching as a separate step or finding a good point to fetch
* [ ] Toilet/Point of Interest etc in Planning and pdf
* [ ] An iframe display for the table and the gpx overview and the starting times
  * [ ] UI to adjust the start/meeting timings of the track
  * [ ] How to split the UI to have everything nice on one screen
* [ ] Keep the planning in the background and allow the user to come back to it
  * [ ] Only new or example planning erases the planning
