### Things to integrate
* speed settings for single gpx file on the dropdown on the gpx tab
* Other settings via a dialog
* Api keys somewhere and then also a feedback if the automatic fetching did not work
  * Using Toasts for this to inform the user?
* Import Export maybe also on the document table
  * There you can download everything you need
* Map mode changes
  * Integrated in the map
* Points maybe via dialog or extra tab?
* Construction sites and others

### Improvement
* break management
  * It should be possible to assign a toilet icon and location
* Warning section or Toast due to missing things
* More interaction on the map, 
  * e.g. right click on segment to add it to a route or so
  * Splitting a route into two parts via the Map, with a right click
  * Other feedback from Leo
* Having a mode for only a simple demonstration
  * No tracks
  * segments can be reordered and breaks added
* More permanent overwrite of streetnames oder modification
* Validation for the document creation
* Initial map location via ip address or such
* Having a smooth user experience when using the tool
* Maybe one button to trigger a clean creation
* Maybe improve handling on the nodes
* Settings for start time communication or such not having it in code
* Button or example on copying something for an iframe

### Backend like improvement
* Being able to save the planning (just as such send an json)
* Also being able to publish it
  * With some settings
  * Maybe favicon 
  * Name
  * Description
  * Links
  * As Table or as Cards on map
* Allowing to compare between multiple plannings easily
