# Architecture Decisions

## React-Redux-Localstorage Setup

We chose a browser based setup in combination with localstorage.
- (+) easy to use for everyone
- (+) a simple way to create a UI
- (-) extra setup for react instead of a script 

## Simple Backend instead of uploading jsons to github
- (-) extra work
- (-) more complexity in the code
- (+) ease of use, no github account for users required anymore
- (+) reduces the time to publish a new version
